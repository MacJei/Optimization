# Optimization course

The main goal of the course was to empower us with knowledge about the optimization algorithms that
essentially take the most computation time in the fitting and computation of the machine learning model.
Thus, to be able to make informed decisions while choosing the ML model class, the fitting strategy and
even the manual implementation.
